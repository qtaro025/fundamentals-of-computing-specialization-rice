# Principles of Computing (Part 1)

This directory contains coursework completed as part of **Principles of Computing (Part 1)**,
offered by Rice University in the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization.

Content includes:
- `examples/`: lecture sample code and small demonstrations
- `homework/`: practice assignments and short exercises
- `practice_activity/`: practice assignment related to the lecture material
- `practice_mini_projects/`: smaller projects related to the projects
- `projects/`: larger course projects (integrating multiple modules)

Original project implementations were developed using **CodeSkulptor 2** (browser-based Python) since the Machine Grader still uses Python 2.
