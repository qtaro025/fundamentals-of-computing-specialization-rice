# Fundamentals of Computing Specialization

#### Offered by Rice University on Coursera

This repository contains coursework, notes, and programming projects completed as part of
the **Fundamentals of Computing Specialization** offered by Rice University.

The specialization covers material equivalent to introductory undergraduate Computer
Science coursework and concludes with a capstone exam assessing cumulative knowledge.

Original programming assignments were implemented using **CodeSkulptor**, a browser-based
Python environment. Selected projects will be reimplemented using desktop (Tkinter) and
web-based (React) frameworks in future revisions to demonstrate platform-independent design
and continued skill development.
